# Finance_Calculator
The 'Finance Calculator' project is a program written in Python, it is a program designed for use by a small finance company to allow them access to two different financial calculators, i.e an investment calculator and a home loan repayment calculator.

This was one of the first Capstone Projects I worked on during the duration of my Software Engineering Bootcamp at Hyperion Development.
